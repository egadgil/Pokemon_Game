Programming Project 1.08: Loading Pokémon

Overview
In this phase of the project, we focus on loading Pokémon into our game from parsed data files. While the complexities of Pokémon main series games (MSGs) are simplified, we provide a robust framework for encountering Pokémon. This implementation sets the groundwork for future expansions including battling and capturing, which will be tackled in subsequent projects.

Features
Pokémon Encounters: When moving through tall grass, each step has a 10% chance of triggering an encounter with any Pokémon from our dataset of 1092 species. Encounters include everything from common Pokémon to legendary and mythical creatures.
Level Calculation: Pokémon levels are determined by the Manhattan distance from the origin point on the map:
Up to a distance of 200, the Pokémon level ranges from 1 to half the distance value.
Beyond a distance of 200, the minimum level is calculated as (distance - 200) / 2, with the maximum level capped at 100.
Moves Selection: Pokémon know up to two moves based on their level. The moves are selected uniformly from the Pokémon’s level-up learnset.
Stats Generation: Pokémon stats are calculated using the formula:
HP = ((((base_stat + IV) * 2) * level) / 100) + level + 10
Other stats = ((((base_stat + IV) * 2) * level) / 100) + 5
Gender and Shiny Mechanics: Simplified mechanics for Pokémon gender and shiny probability. Shiny Pokémon have a simplified 1 in 8192 chance, determined by a random function.
Simplifications
Gender and Shiny Rates: All Pokémon have an equal chance of being male or female, and the shiny rate is determined by rand() % 8192 == 0.
IVs and Stats: IVs for each stat are uniformly distributed between 0 and 15. We are omitting Effort Values (EVs) to simplify growth calculations.
Encounter Mechanics: Unlike MSGs, any Pokémon can appear in any tall grass, regardless of game lore or typical habitat.
Data Files and Handling
Pokémon Moves: Sourced from pokemon_moves.csv, where moves are matched with Pokémon species and appropriate levels from their respective games. Due to disparities in game versions post-Pokémon Sword and Shield (Dexit), care must be taken with version group IDs.
Stat Mapping: pokemon_stats.csv and stats.csv are used to map Pokémon base stats for calculations.
Implementation Notes
Initial Pokémon Choice: At the start of the game, the player is presented with three randomly generated level 1 Pokémon to choose from.
NPCs and Pokémon: All NPCs are generated with at least one Pokémon, adhering to the encounter and level rules based on their location on the map.
Encounter and Battle Placeholder: Current implementation includes placeholders for battle and capture mechanics, which will be fully implemented in the next project phase



Note : Run make all and then ./poke327 to run the game.
