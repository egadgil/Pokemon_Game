COM S 327, Spring 2024 Programming Project 1.09: Pokémon Battles Overview

This update introduces the Pokémon battle minigame, focusing on turn-based interactions between trainers or between a trainer and a wild Pokémon. The game simplifies existing Pokémon battle mechanics by excluding status effects and Pokémon abilities due to their complexity.

Key Battle Mechanics:
Turn-based Actions: Each participant takes turns, choosing actions such as using a Pokémon move, switching Pokémon, using items, or attempting to flee.
Move Priority and Execution:
Non-move actions (like using items) are prioritized.
If both parties choose Pokémon moves, the one with higher priority executes first. If priorities tie, the faster Pokémon goes first. Ties in speed are resolved randomly.
Moves can miss, simplified to a direct percentage check (rand() mod 100 ≤ moves.accuracy).
Damage calculation omits complex elements, using only basic stats and types:


Damage = (((2 × Level + 2) × Power × Attack / Defense + 2) / 50) × Critical × random × STAB × Type
Critical hits occur based on a random threshold related to the Pokémon's speed.
Battle Options:
Fight: Pokémon uses a chosen move.
Bag: Use items like potions for healing or Pokéballs for capturing wild Pokémon.
Run: Only possible against wild Pokémon, with a hard-coded chance of success.
Pokémon: Switch the active Pokémon; uses up a turn.
Implementation Notes:
Begin with limited items: a few potions, revives, and Pokéballs.
Capturing mechanics are simplified for now: capturing succeeds if the trainer has fewer than 6 Pokémon.
NPCs select moves randomly and only switch Pokémon upon knockout.
Pokémon do not automatically heal after battles; healing occurs at Pokémon Centers or via items from the bag outside battles.
AI Considerations:
AI behavior can be simple, prioritizing random moves and basic tactics like switching out a defeated Pokémon.
This summary captures the essence of the programming project, focusing on the simplified battle system setup and essential game mechanics.
